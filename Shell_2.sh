# 4. Make the shell script executable
chmod +x predict_richness.sh

./predict_richness.sh

# Run the shell script
bash predict_richness.sh

# Add the new files to SVN:
svn add predict_richness.sh predicted_diversities.txt

# Commit the changes:
svn commit -m "Added predict_richness.sh and predicted_diversities.txt"

# Optional Step: Modify and Commit rich_pred.py
# If you choose to modify rich_pred.py to make it a self-contained unit:
# Edit rich_pred.py:
nano rich_pred.py

# Modify the script to include the necessary functions and use fileinput.input(). For example:
import fileinput

# python
def predict_richness(area):
    # Replace this with the actual function for predicting richness
    return float(area) * 1.23  # Example calculation

if __name__ == "__main__":

#!/bin/bash


# Navigate to the assignment directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Find all areas files in subdirectories and combine them into one file
